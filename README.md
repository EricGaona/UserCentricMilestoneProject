# Eric Gaona Portfolio
User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project - Code Institute

This is my portfolio website to present to prospective employers. The portfolio highlights six projects that cover a range of technologies, as well as including a bit about myself, my coding skills, and a contact form. 

## UX
My goal in the design was to create a friendly site, easy to understand and navigate. Always thinking about making it responsive.

For employers, I wanted to provide them with a short overview of myself and my capabilities via a user friendly design. This way, they would be able to know who I am, my background, work I've done, and my skills, with the option to contact me if they choose.


## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS

## Features
This site uses the semantics of HTML5 and in CSS they were used media query, float, position, transform nad some more.

## Features Left to Implement
In the future, I would like to add a collapsed regardless navbar for mobile devices. I would like to also validate the form.

## Testing
This site was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Opera, Internet Explorer, FireFox) and on multiple mobile devices (iPhone 4, 5, 7: Chrome,  iPad, Samsung Galaxy) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. 

## Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named index.html.
